# st - Simple Terminal (Carson's Build)
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less. This build contains modifications and patches that I have deemed worthwhile to have in the terminal. The original repository for st can be found here: https://git.suckless.org/st/.

# Noteable Changes
- Changed zoom in/out key bindings to match vim key bindings (Alt-Shift-K/Alt-Shift-J).
- Changed starting font size.
- Cursor color set to tan.
- Font set to Mono Nerd Font

# Patches
- Gruvbox color scheme.
- Alpha (X window transparency, dependency on transset or similar program).
- Blinking cursor.
